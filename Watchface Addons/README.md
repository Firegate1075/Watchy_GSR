In here will be Watchface Addons, other people may make repositories of such, though the ones in her are designed to be #include'd at the top of your GSR.ino (just below the only include present).  Place them in the order you want them to show up in the Watchface list.

All of these files can contain 1 or more than one Watchface, currently a limit of 32 is present, if people really want more, just put in an Issue asking for more.

There is also (going to be) an "empty watchface" that you can use as a starting point.
