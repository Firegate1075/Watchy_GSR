**NEW** Version numbered folders are now be within the src folder, releases should be Git pulled from the releases section.

BE sure to read the Compilation Instructions or this will not compile.

For Arduino users, see the Compile Settings.BMP in the above folder for settings on how to setup your Arduino.

For PlatformIO users, there is a PlatformIO.ini in the root directory of this repository that'll set that up.
